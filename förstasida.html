          <p>One of the primary reasons why olives are good to eat is their rich nutritional profile. They are a good source of monounsaturated fats, which are known to promote heart health by reducing bad cholesterol levels. These healthy fats also aid in maintaining a healthy weight and managing blood sugar levels. Additionally, olives are packed with antioxidants, including vitamin E, which helps protect the body against cell damage caused by harmful free radicals.</p>
